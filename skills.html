            <h1>My acquired skills as a Developer</h1>
            <h2>1. HTML (HyperText Markup Language)</h2>
            <p>I use HTML to structure web pages, ensuring that every element—headings, paragraphs, images, and links—is properly placed for a clean and accessible layout.</p>
            <h2>2. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</h2>
            <p>I bring websites to life with CSS, making them visually appealing. I focus on layouts, colors, animations, and responsiveness to create a seamless user experience.</p>
            <h2>3. JavaScript (JS)</h2>
            <p>JavaScript is my tool for adding interactivity. Whether it’s form validation, dynamic content updates, or animations, I use JS to enhance user engagement.</p>
            <h2>4. Responsive Design</h2>
            <p>I ensure that my websites look and function well on all devices—desktops, tablets, and mobile phones—using CSS media queries.</p>
            <h2>5. Database Management (SQL)</h2>
            <p>I store and manage data efficiently using databases like MySQL and MongoDB, ensuring secure and fast retrieval of information for dynamic web applications.</p>
            <h2>6. Version Control (Git & GitHub)</h2>
            <p>I track changes in my code using Git, collaborate with teams using GitHub, and ensure that every version of a project is well-managed and recoverable.</p>
            <h2>7. API Integration (REST, GraphQL)</h2>
            <p>I integrate third-party services like payment gateways, Google Maps, and social media APIs, allowing my websites to connect with external platforms smoothly.</p>
            <h2>8. Problem-Solving & Debugging</h2>
            <p>When issues arise, I efficiently debug my code using Chrome DevTools, console logs, and various testing tools to fix errors and optimize performance.</p>
            <h2>9. Soft Skills (Communication, Teamwork, Time Management)</h2>
            <p>Beyond technical skills, I communicate effectively with clients and teams, manage time efficiently, and collaborate to deliver high-quality projects on schedule.</p>
