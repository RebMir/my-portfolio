                <p>Hi, I’m Rebeccah Miruka, a passionate and dedicated software development student with a growing interest in full-stack web development. 
                I enjoy building clean, user-friendly websites and solving real-world problems through code. 
                Currently, I’m focused on learning and mastering the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) as I work toward becoming a professional full-stack developer. 
                My journey so far has given me a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I’m continuously expanding my skills to create dynamic and responsive applications. 
                I’m excited about the future of technology and look forward to contributing innovative solutions to the tech world. 
                Welcome to my portfolio—take a look around and feel free to connect! </p>
